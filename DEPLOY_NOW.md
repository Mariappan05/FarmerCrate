# 🚀 Deploy Now - Email Fixed!

## ✅ What Was Fixed

1. **Unified Email Handler** (`src/utils/email.js`)
   - Tries SendGrid first (works in production)
   - Falls back to Gmail SMTP (works locally)
   - No more `nodemailer.createTransporter is not a function` error

2. **Updated Dependencies** (`package.json`)
   - Added `@sendgrid/mail` for production emails
   - Added `axios` for API calls

3. **Updated Auth Controller**
   - Now uses unified email handler
   - Automatic fallback between services

---

## 📦 Step 1: Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

This will install:
- `@sendgrid/mail@^8.1.4`
- `axios@^1.7.9`

---

## 🔑 Step 2: Get SendGrid API Key (2 minutes)

1. Go to: https://signup.sendgrid.com/
2. Sign up (FREE - 100 emails/day)
3. Verify your email
4. Go to: Settings → API Keys
5. Create API Key → Full Access
6. Copy the key (starts with `SG.`)

---

## ⚙️ Step 3: Set Environment Variables in Production

In your Render dashboard, add:

```
SENDGRID_API_KEY=SG.your_actual_key_here
EMAIL_USER=farmercrate@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=ozihonxsuhkumrpp
NODE_ENV=production
```

---

## ✉️ Step 4: Verify Sender Email (IMPORTANT!)

1. Go to: https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/sender_auth
2. Click "Verify a Single Sender"
3. Fill in:
   - From Name: `FarmerCrate`
   - From Email: `farmercrate@gmail.com`
   - Reply To: `farmercrate@gmail.com`
   - Address: (any address)
4. Click "Create"
5. Check your email and click verification link

**Without this step, SendGrid will reject emails!**

---

## 🚢 Step 5: Deploy

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix: Unified email handler with SendGrid support"
git push
```

Render will automatically deploy.

---

## ✅ Step 6: Test

### Test Customer First Login:

```bash
curl -X POST https://farmercrate.onrender.com/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "username": "John Doe",
    "password": "customer123"
  }'
```

### Expected Response:
```json
{
  "message": "First login detected. OTP sent to your email.",
  "requiresOTP": true,
  "email": "customer@example.com",
  "tempToken": "eyJhbGc..."
}
```

### Check Logs:
```
=== SENDING EMAIL ===
From: farmercrate@gmail.com
To: customer@example.com
OTP: 123456
Environment: production
Attempting SendGrid...
✅ Email sent via SendGrid!
=== EMAIL SENT ===
```

### Check Email Inbox:
Customer should receive email with OTP code.

## 🎯 How It Works

### Production (Render):
1. Tries SendGrid (HTTP API) ✅
2. Works because no SMTP ports blocked
3. Email delivered successfully

### Local Development:
1. Tries SendGrid (if API key set)
2. Falls back to Gmail SMTP ✅
3. Works on localhost

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Error: "The from email does not match a verified Sender Identity"
**Solution**: Complete Step 4 (Verify Sender Email)

### Error: "API key not valid"
**Solution**: 
1. Check SENDGRID_API_KEY in environment variables
2. Make sure you copied the full key (starts with `SG.`)
3. Regenerate key if needed

### Still using Gmail SMTP in production?
**Check**: Make sure `SENDGRID_API_KEY` is set in production environment

### Email not received?
**Check**:
1. Spam folder
2. SendGrid sender verification completed
3. Production logs for error messages
