# Admin User CASCADE Delete Functions - Test Data & API Documentation

## Overview
This document provides comprehensive test data and API documentation for admin user CASCADE delete functionality. The delete operations are implemented as **CASCADE deletes** that permanently remove users and all their related data from the database.

‚ö†Ô∏è **WARNING: CASCADE DELETE OPERATIONS ARE PERMANENT AND IRREVERSIBLE**

## Base URL
```
http://localhost:3000/api/admin
```

## Authentication Required
All admin endpoints require authentication with admin JWT token:
```http
Authorization: Bearer <admin_jwt_token>
```

## CASCADE Delete Behavior

### What Gets Deleted with Each User Type:

#### üåæ **Farmer Deletion** ‚Üí Cascades to:
- ‚úÖ All farmer's **Products** 
- ‚úÖ All **Orders** related to farmer's products
- ‚úÖ All **Cart items** containing farmer's products  
- ‚úÖ All **Wishlist items** for farmer's products
- ‚úÖ All farmer's **Transactions**

#### üõí **Customer Deletion** ‚Üí Cascades to:
- ‚úÖ All customer's **Orders**
- ‚úÖ All customer's **Cart items**
- ‚úÖ All customer's **Wishlist items**

#### üöõ **Transporter Deletion** ‚Üí Cascades to:
- ‚úÖ All transporter's **Delivery Persons**
- ‚úÖ All transporter's **Permanent Vehicles** (and their documents)
- ‚úÖ All transporter's **Temporary Vehicles** (and their documents)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Orders assigned to delivery persons get `delivery_person_id = NULL`

#### üèçÔ∏è **Delivery Person Deletion** ‚Üí Cascades to:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Orders get `delivery_person_id = NULL` (orders preserved)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CASCADE Delete Impact Analysis

### Before Deleting - Data Dependencies Check

#### Farmer Impact:
```bash
# Check farmer's products and related data
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3000/api/admin/users/farmer/1" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ADMIN_TOKEN"

# Check products by farmer
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3000/api/products?farmer_id=1" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

#### Customer Impact:
```bash
# Check customer's orders and cart
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3000/api/admin/users/customer/1" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ADMIN_TOKEN"

# Check customer orders
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3000/api/orders/customer/1" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

#### Transporter Impact:
```bash

curl -X GET "http://localhost:3000/api/vehicles" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer TRANSPORTER_TOKEN"

curl -X GET "http://localhost:3000/api/delivery-persons" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer TRANSPORTER_TOKEN"
```

## Test Data Setup for CASCADE Testing

### Create Rich Test Data (with dependencies)

#### 1. Create Farmer with Products
```http
POST /api/auth/register/farmer
{
  "name": "Ravi Kumar",
  "email": "ravi.farmer@example.com",
  "mobile_number": "9876543210",
  "password": "FarmerPass123!",
  "address": "Village Kumta, Karnataka"
}

# Then create products for this farmer
POST /api/products
{
  "name": "Organic Tomatoes",
  "price": 50.00,
  "quantity": 100,
  "farmer_id": 1
}
```

#### 2. Create Customer with Orders and Cart

POST /api/auth/register/customer
{
  "customer_name": "Priya Sharma", 
  "email": "priya.customer@example.com",
  "mobile_number": "9876543212",
  "password": "CustomerPass123!"
}

# Add items to cart

  "quantity": 3
}
```

#### 3. Create Transporter with Vehicles
```http
POST /api/auth/register/transporter
{
  "name": "Raj Transport Solutions",

  "mobile_number": "9876543214",
  "password": "TransportPass123!"
}

# Add vehicles
POST /api/vehicles/permanent
{
  "vehicle_number": "KA01AB1234",
  "vehicle_type": "truck",
  "capacity_kg": 5000.00,

## CASCADE Delete Commands

### Delete Operations with Full CASCADE

#### Delete Farmer (and all products, orders, transactions)
```bash
curl -X DELETE "http://localhost:3000/api/admin/farmers/1" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ADMIN_TOKEN"
```

#### Delete Customer (and all orders, cart, wishlist)
```bash
curl -X DELETE "http://localhost:3000/api/admin/customers/1" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ADMIN_TOKEN"
```

#### Delete Transporter (and all vehicles, delivery persons)
```bash
curl -X DELETE "http://localhost:3000/api/admin/transporters/1" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ADMIN_TOKEN"
```

#### Delete Delivery Person (orders preserved with NULL delivery_person_id)
```bash
curl -X DELETE "http://localhost:3000/api/admin/delivery-persons/1" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ADMIN_TOKEN"
```

## Verification After CASCADE Delete

### Verify Complete Deletion

#### Check Farmer Deletion Impact:
```bash
# These should return empty or "not found"
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3000/api/products?farmer_id=1"
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3000/api/admin/users/farmer/1"
```

#### Check Customer Deletion Impact:
```bash
# These should return empty or "not found"
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3000/api/orders/customer/1"
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3000/api/cart/customer/1"
```

#### Check Transporter Deletion Impact:
```bash
# These should return empty or "not found"
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3000/api/vehicles" # (with deleted transporter token - should fail)
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3000/api/delivery-persons" # (should be empty)
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Production Safety Guidelines

### Pre-Delete Checklist:
1. **Backup Database** before any CASCADE delete operations
2. **Verify User ID** is correct before deletion
3. **Check Dependencies** - review what will be deleted
4. **Confirm with Stakeholders** for high-impact deletions
5. **Test on Staging** environment first

### Recovery Options:
- **Database Restore** from backup (only option for CASCADE delete)
- **Data Export** before deletion for potential reconstruction
- **Audit Logs** to track what was deleted and when

### Recommended Workflow:
```bash
# 1. Backup
pg_dump farmercrate_db > backup_before_delete_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).sql

# 2. Analyze impact
curl -X GET "/api/admin/users/farmer/1" -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN"

# 3. Confirm deletion
curl -X DELETE "/api/admin/farmers/1" -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN"

# 4. Verify deletion
curl -X GET "/api/admin/users/farmer/1" -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN"  # Should return 404
```

## Testing Workflow

1. **Setup Phase:**
   - Register admin and get token
   - Create test users with rich relational data
   - Verify relationships are established

2. **Impact Analysis:**
   - Check what data will be deleted for each user type
   - Document dependencies before deletion

3. **CASCADE Delete Tests:**
   - Delete each user type and verify cascade behavior
   - Confirm related data is properly removed

4. **Verification:**
   - Ensure all related records are deleted
   - Verify referential integrity maintained
   - Check for orphaned records

5. **Error Handling:**
   - Test invalid IDs, unauthorized access
   - Verify proper error messages

**Note:** CASCADE delete operations are permanent and cannot be undone. Always backup your database before performing these operations in production.
